# TAIL

There are several commands to view the contents of a file in Linux. Tail command is one of them.

And as the name suggests, the tail command is used to print the end part of a file. This can be useful when dealing with config files where the new changes are made to the end of the file.

The tail command also allows you to view the changes made to a file live. This is extensively used for monitoring log files in real-time while troubleshooting issues.

In this tutorial, I will show how you can use the tail command by sharing some practical examples of it.

## How to use the tail command in Linux

To use any command in the terminal, execution of the command in the right syntax is compulsory, so let's start with its syntax first.
